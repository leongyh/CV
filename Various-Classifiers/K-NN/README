the recommended tools (available via the 
Anaconda package).The format of which
the code is presented is through an
iPython notebook both for convinience and
clarity. iPython can be obtained via the
Anaconda package as well. Run the command 
"ipython notebook" on the terminal to access
iPython. Look for the file "knn.ipynb" and
open it.
