Instructions
--------------------------------
The assignment is coded in Python using
the recommended tools (available via the 
Anaconda package).The format of which
the code is presented is through an
iPython notebook both for convinience and
clarity. iPython can be obtained via the
Anaconda package as well. Run the command 
"ipython notebook" on the terminal to access
iPython. Look for the file "hw5.ipynb" and
open it.

The file contains the data preproccessor
and classes to the DTree and Random Forest. 
The file creates and runs accuracy tests on both 
classifiers. There are 3 included segmentation
methods (brute force, means of means, and 
brute force with random attribute selection)
which can be passed during the tree intialization
It also runs the kaggle tests.
Please run the data preprocessing segment first.
