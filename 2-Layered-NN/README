The 2NN is coded in Python using
 tools from the 
Anaconda package. The format of which
 the code is presented is through an 
iPython notebook both for convinience and 
clarity. iPython can be obtained via the 
Anaconda package as well. Run the command 
"ipython notebook" on the terminal to access
 iPython. 

The Neural Net is wrapped in a class and 
the train fuction takes in parameters 
learning rate, a specified dampening 
function for the learning rate in the form
 f(rate, iterations) and returns a rate, threshold.
The analytics function does the plotting and takes 
parameter of max iterations to run.
